The Productivity and Time Tracker Chrome Extension is a browser-based tool designed to help users monitor and analyze their web usage habits by automatically tracking the amount of time spent on various websites and categorizing them based on productivity. By leveraging Chrome’s tabs and storage APIs, the extension silently runs in the background, detecting when users switch between tabs or when a tab finishes loading, recording time spent on each domain without requiring any manual input. This time data is stored locally using chrome.storage.local, ensuring persistence across browsing sessions while maintaining user privacy. Sites are grouped into three categories: productive (like GitHub and Stack Overflow), unproductive (such as Facebook, YouTube, and Instagram), and uncategorized (any site not explicitly defined), allowing for a clear visual distinction using color codes—green for productive, red for unproductive, and gray for others. The extension’s popup interface, built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, integrates Chart.js to generate a dynamic and responsive bar chart that visually represents the time distribution across websites, making it easy for users to comprehend their browsing behavior at a glance. This extension is particularly useful for students, professionals, and anyone seeking to manage their digital time more effectively, helping to cultivate better online habits by promoting self-awareness. It operates with a minimalist and user-friendly design, requiring no configuration after installation, and delivers immediate value by revealing where time is spent online. The extension also includes clear visual cues to differentiate site categories, which helps users quickly identify and reflect on the proportion of productive versus unproductive time. Potential future enhancements include enabling user customization for productive and unproductive site lists, providing daily or weekly usage summaries, offering additional visualization types like pie charts or line graphs, and incorporating notifications or alerts when a threshold of time is spent on distracting websites. Altogether, this Chrome Extension offers a privacy-friendly, lightweight, and effective solution for anyone looking to improve their productivity and become more intentional with their time online. It combines automation, data visualization, and simplicity to make productivity tracking an effortless part of the user’s browsing experience, offering a compelling alternative to complex time management software while remaining completely contained within the browser environment.
